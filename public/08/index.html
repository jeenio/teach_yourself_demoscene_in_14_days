<p>As previously mentioned there are plenty of ways to make a demo. The only &ldquo;right way&rdquo; is your own way, the one that is the most interesting and fun for you.</p>
<p>That being said, an effective rule to ensure a release will be released is to aim for achievable goals.</p>
<p>If you are not reasonable with your goals you&rsquo;ll soon find yourself demotivated and failing to meet the deadline. For most projects it&rsquo;s better to start small and build on top of what you already have working.</p>
<p>If you have no idea where to start here are a few pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people try to replicate some effects after seeing something interesting on other demos, movies, adverts or nature. Building up a batch of different effects which can later be adapted to match a track.</li>
<li>Others prefer to nail down a concept first and only then get to work on it&rsquo;s different components.</li>
<li>Some sceners only feel the drive to create something when they are challenged with a very specific issue.</li>
<li>Some coders only do engines, frameworks and tools. Sharing them with other sceners to see what they can do with them.</li>
<li>Some graphicians fool around with engines and tools until something seems interesting.</li>
<li>Some musicians prepare timelines and storyboards for their sounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these approaches are valid. As mentioned several times already: demoscene is a hobby. So don&rsquo;t treat it as work, do whatever you like whenever you feel like doing it.</p>
<p>Some pro tips to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a finite number of productive hours per day, there is a finite number of days until the demoparty deadline, aim for achievable goals. If you achieve them fast, build on top of them.</li>
<li>If you have no ideas, try random things. Eventually you will come up with a concept. Don&rsquo;t let a lack of initial concept paralyse you.</li>
<li>Work on the project at least 5 minutes each day, even if it&rsquo;s just tweaking some colors. This helps to keep the project in the back of your mind and eventually you will find the motivation to spend more then just 5 minutes and do a bigger push.</li>
<li>Communicate your progress with your team mates. They might give you important feedback, and it can also motivate them to contribute.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you keep all these things in mind by the end of day 8 you should be able to lay down a work plan aimed at reaching achievable goals.</p>
