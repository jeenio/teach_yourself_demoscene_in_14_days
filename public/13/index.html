<p>Demoparties are where demosceners gather to meet each other, finish their productions and share them on the big screen.</p>
<p>At some point some folks realized there was more to life then sitting inside a smelly party place finishing entries. They realized there was a whole world out there to be explored. I&rsquo;m ofcourse talking about the outside of the partyplace, where the demosceners gather to meet each other, talk about how late they are running to finish their productions on time or just idle around, waiting for the compos to start on the big screen.</p>
<p>As it happens, inside of demoparty halls regulations tend to be more strict. You usually can&rsquo;t eat, drink or smoke. Sometimes the sound is too loud. In other occasions they won&rsquo;t let you make any sound of your own. And so, after a few hours of working on your entry, you tend to enjoy walking outside to get some air. This is the perfect opportunity to socialize with fellow demosceners who are doing the same, just outside the partyplace. And this is why demosceners are known to mention that the real party is outside.</p>
<p>During particularly cold winters this task can be challenging. For these occasions demosceners have repurposed the ancient sacred technology of gathering wood and setting it on fire, these are known as campfires and they become social gathering points where sceners crowd to bond and warm each other you up. They are free to join.</p>
<p>Demoparties typically have certain areas reserved for sleeping. These are called sleeping areas. These are not the most indicated place to eat, drink, smoke or socialize. Demosceners (like any other creature) tend to dislike being awakened when they are tired and will often complain that you the real party is outside and that you should go there. You should strongly follow their advice.</p>
<p>Socializing is important. Sceners are usually quite social. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of talking to random demosceners. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of introducing yourself to people whose work you admire. By experience i can tell you they will most likely appreciate your interest and share with you their thoughts on your work and your methods. They might even give you some insight and motivation on how to improve the entry you are currently working on.</p>
<p>Last but not least remember not to be an ass. No one likes annoying people, be them demosceners or not. If you can&rsquo;t communicate without being rude keep your opinions to yourself. If you can&rsquo;t hold your alcohol, don&rsquo;t drink yourself silly. This should be common knowledge but it&rsquo;s always useful to keep in mind.</p>
<p>By the end of the 13th day you should know where the real party is located and not be afraid to go there.</p>
