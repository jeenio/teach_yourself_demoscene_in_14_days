  <h2 id="day-12---crunch-time">Day 12 - Crunch Time</h2>
<p>The good thing about a deadline is that you see it coming months ahead, so technically speaking you can actually plan for something decent and start on time.</p>
<p>But ofcourse that the thing about deadlines is that - unless you&rsquo;re a total control freak - they tend to sneak up on you. You start off thinking you have lots of time, so you plan this huge awesome project, and then as time grows shorter you start realizing you aren&rsquo;t actually keeping up with your workplan and that your idea needs to be replaced by something simpler.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, my suggestion to avoid this point of failure is to always plan realistically. Build the core of your entry early on and then spend the extra time before the deadline polishing things up, testing it on different machines and maybe getting feedback from people whose opinion you respect?</p>
<p>Some folks enjoy procastinating a lot, discussing what the project could be, over and over again, instead of actually trying things or following the plan to accomplish what was already defined. These people tend to re-open things that were already closed and done with, etc. Planning things properly is very important, but at some point you need to stop planning and just close things. This is what crunch time is for, when the deadline is looming close and you desperatly want to finish your release, you enter crunch time and close things down.</p>
<p>Crunch time means you and your team are sitting down together to work on all the things that need to get done, and not leaving until they are all done. No interruptions except for food, bathroom and sleep.</p>
<p>Productivity under crunch time is often higher then average, but it will soon start to deteriorate as the crunch period extends itself. This is normal, you and your team are only human, you will get tired and start to lose focus and patience. Long crunch times can be counter productive. They can also leave you quite burned out. So learn to plan ahead and avoid unnecessary crunch time periods.</p>
<p>Typically crunch time should only be enforced to wrap things up: Clean the last bugs, implement the last effect, integrate the final artwork, tweak some colors and syncs.</p>
<p>To push the project forward some people enjoy doing their projects in semi-regular sprints. A sprint is a short period of time where you enter crunch mode totally focused on that project alone. They are great ways to kickstart a project, tackle a specific project hurdle or just add some more content to a project that&rsquo;s been idling.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re planning your project and defining some sprints or crunch time, be aware that your end result is never quite what you intended to achieve, always reserve some buffer time to redo everything, clear bugs or scrap everything and start anew. Buffer time should typically be an extra 20% or 50% of what you realistically estimated for the task. Some people are more horrible then others at predicting or controlling how much time they spend on each specific task and require bigger buffer times or a simple reality check to help them close the task and shift their focus to the next one on the plan.</p>
<p>Creative projects always take longer then initially expected. This is completely normal and the only thing you should do about it is to expect it. If it&rsquo;s not obvious enough let me lay it out explicitly, it&rsquo;s due to two very simple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>any creative process involves dealing with unknowns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can&rsquo;t estimate unknowns</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A project that falls exactly onto it&rsquo;s predicted timeframe is a project where you were surely not being creative enough. Fucking boring if you ask me, but go for whatever rocks your boat.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb to deliver on time is to always keep your codebase fully playable, if you are missing assets (sound or graphics) use stand-ins, don&rsquo;t spend too much time on them (they will be replaced anyways), do them as horrible and quickly as possible, just make sure they are in the expected format. Then send that preview to the person responsible for the assets and ask them to replace them when ready. And focus your time tweaking something else until you hear back from them for a new version.</p>
<p>By the end of day 12 you should know the dangers and importance of crunch times to deliver a demoscene entry on time. Use them wisely!</p>
