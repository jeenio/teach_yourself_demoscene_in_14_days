  <h2 id="day-5---basics-of-code">Day 5 - Basics of Code</h2>
<p>Learning how to program is relatively easy, there are tons of books and free courses on the subject. <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> or <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> are as good places as any to learn how to program in general. You&rsquo;ll need to learn about variables, functions, classes, data structures, loops and algorithms.</p>
<p>There are many programming languages, platforms and styles of programming with their respective zealots preaching &ldquo;the way&rdquo;. Some languages favor certain styles over others but overall you should focus on the language you&rsquo;re most interested in learning or most comfortable with.</p>
<p>To avoid the initial frustration of not being able to get something showing on screen while you build your rendering engine you should probably start learning graphics programming using environments such as <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> of <a href="https://cables.gl/">cables.gl</a>, these environments are great ways to get something going fast and you can always move away from them and do your own engine later on when you&rsquo;re more experienced. Some folks have prepared a <a href="https://github.com/anttihirvonen/demoscene-starter-kits">demoscene starter kit</a>.</p>
<p>There are many ways to program a demo. There is no such thing as the single best way. In other words, you should do demos as it feels most natural to you. As long as the entry gets done in time to get shown on the big screen, you&rsquo;re doing it right.</p>
<p>Some programmers get a bit caught up in the right way to code, reading books, following best practices, debating them, learning new trendy methologies or endlessly refactoring their code and never actually releasing a demo. If that&rsquo;s you i strongly suggest that you take a look at <a href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/">http://programming-motherfucker.com/</a> and just release your first demo.</p>
<p>Another point worth addressing is that you don&rsquo;t have to prepare the entire development chaintool / engine / framework yourself to do a demo. Some folks prefer to work on tools / engines / frameworks and then having other demosceners use them to make demos. While others hate developing tools and engines and just enjoy putting a demo together. Of course it&rsquo;s useful to dabble on both sides of the spectrum, but at the end of the day you should focus on what you are most interested or comfortable with.</p>
<p>There are some great online resources to learn programming graphics. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning <a href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> you can check the good old <a href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/">NeHe Tutorials</a> or the more recent <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">Learn OpenGL</a> tutorial website. Another useful reference is <a href="https://alain.xyz/blog/raw-opengl">Raw OpenGL</a> A more recent bible of modern graphics programming is also the <a href="http://www.pbr-book.org/">Physically Based Rendering</a> book. Also worth checking is the complete list of <a href="https://github.com/terkelg/awesome-creative-coding">Awesome Creative Coding</a>.</p>
<p>Most demo effects in the recent years (2010-2018) are heavily based on pixel and fragment shaders, either coded in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb509638(v=vs.85).aspx">HLSL</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language">GLSL</a>. To learn shader coding you have this great online book called <a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">The Book of Shaders</a>. There is also a well known online sandbox for open source GLSL experiments known as <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shadertoy</a>. If you seen shader live coding during demoscene events it&rsquo;s likely that it was done using <a href="https://github.com/TheNuSan/Bonzomatic">Bonzomatic</a>, <a href="https://livecode.demozoo.org/about.html#mc">LCDZ</a> archives such livecoding events, with sourcecode and references to tools and tutorials to get started.</p>
<p>If interested in doing tiny bytesize intros (128bytes, 256bytes, 512bytes) you can find some great resources on this subject at <a href="http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/Main_Page">sizecoding.org</a>. If you&rsquo;re more interested in 1k / 4k / 8k development, you can find useful resources at <a href="https://in4k.github.io/">in4k</a>. If you&rsquo;re aiming for 64k there is <a href="https://64k-scene.github.io/">64k-scene</a>.</p>
<p>Try to program a new effect each day and you&rsquo;ll eventually start to get the hang of it and figure out which areas you should read up on to improve your skillset.</p>
<p>By the end of day 5 you should know what it takes to take on the programming role of demomaking.</p>
