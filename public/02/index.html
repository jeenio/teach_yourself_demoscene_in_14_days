<p>On the second day of the rest of your life you should figure out what you want to do on the demoscene.</p>
<p>A demo is usually a group effort. Sceners are typically divided into 3 roles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Graphician - responsible for the artwork, 3d modeling and animations</li>
<li>Musician - composer and producer of the audio soundtrack</li>
<li>Coder - programmer of &ldquo;effects&rdquo; and tools that will enable you to get your demo done before the deadline</li>
</ol>
<p>You can always just do everything yourself, but it obviously requires a high time investment to be proficient in each of the areas. So it&rsquo;s common practice that sceners specialize in one of the roles while &ldquo;outsourcing&rdquo; the others to their group mates.</p>
<p>So, tell me, what do you want to do when you grow up? Draw imaginary worlds? Annoy your dog with high pitch sounds? Spend your whole night debugging spaghetti code? Now is the right time to think about it. It&rsquo;s never a final binding decision. You can always go back and learn something else, but if you want to finish a demo before the deadline it really helps to know what you will be focusing on first.</p>
<p>There is an additional role in the demoscene, which is the role of the organizer, often not directly involved in the practical production of demos, people in these roles are often critical to a successful sprint and keeping the spirit alive within the group. Their tasks can range from finding complementary group members for the project, managing moods, reminding of deadlines, organizing events, promoting releases, etc.</p>
<p>Remember that a demoscener can easily wear multiple hats of these different roles.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be scared to try out different roles, even if you don&rsquo;t stick with it you will undoubtedly learn invaluable information on how it works. This knowledge will help you in the future.</p>
<p>This does not imply it will be easy to master any of these roles. All of them are life-long commitments that take years of practice and exploration to achieve something you could consider great, but we all have to start somewhere, so let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<p>By the end of day 2 you should have an idea of what you want to more seriously explore. If you have doubts what each role actually entails, i strongly recommend you to google for some beginners tutorials on the different areas.</p>
