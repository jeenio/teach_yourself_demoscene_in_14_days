<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a> is an underground computer art culture. The term demoscene comes from the word demo, short for demonstration. In the context of the demoscene the word demo means a realtime audiovisual application which is demonstrating the capabilities of the machine it runs on.</p>
<p>Demosceners (&ldquo;sceners&rdquo;) are what we call the folks with too much free time that abuse their computer skills to create releases under the demoscene.</p>
<p>Demosceners often use nicknames (&ldquo;nicks&rdquo; or &ldquo;handles&rdquo;) to identify themselves.  They also tend to hang out in so-called demogroups. Some demosceners are active members of multiple demogroups, with or without using the same nickname.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get one thing clear: the demoscene has no commercial purpose. The only thing you&rsquo;ll get out of the demoscene, and this only comes after investing a significant amount of your free time into it, is a few useful softskills and a large community of computer nerd friends.</p>
<p>Demoscene releases are meant to show the limits of the machines, the technical skills and artistic sensibility of the makers. There are no rules to what kind of release you can make on the demoscene. Some demos are made as technical benchmarks, others as conceptual art, most are done just for fun. It is entirely up to you to explore what you like doing and share it with other demosceners.</p>
<p>Demoscene releases can be divided into certain categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track, an audio piece, can be in an executable format, in a tracker module format or in a pre-rendered wav/mp3 format</li>
<li>Graphics entry, drawn or rendered images with fixed resolutions and/or a restricted color palette</li>
<li>Demo, an audiovisual real-time executable demonstration for a certain platform</li>
<li>Intro, typically a demo with file size limitation all packed into a single executable file that includes all the assets (popular size formats are 256bytes, 512bytes, 1kb, 4kb, 8kb, 64kb)</li>
<li>Animation, rendered graphics videos</li>
<li>Demopack, a collection of demos in a single disk</li>
<li>Musicdisk, a collection of demoscene tracks with an executable player interface</li>
<li>Diskmag, a collection of texts about the demoscene with an executable graphics interface</li>
<li>Wild entry, everything else (including live performances, videos of demos on uncommon platforms, videos about demomaking, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Releases typically occur at <a href="http://www.demoparty.net/">demoparties</a>, gathering events for demosceners.</p>
<h4 id="image-of-a-demoparty">image of a demoparty</h4>
<p>Demoparties come in many flavors but they are usually 2 to 3 day events focused on bringing together demosceners and challenge them to participate in a series of competitions (also called compos) on different categories. The entries are shown on the big screen, people vote for what they like and the winners take home a symbolic prize.</p>
<p>Given all this knowledge, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to, in 14 days, make your first demoscene entry, meet some fellow demosceners, participate in a compo at a demoparty and eventually &ldquo;make a megademo-shock to Japanese brain&rdquo; as some sceners say.</p>
<p>On this first day of the rest of your life you should probably still google a bit more about the demoscene and watch some demos! If you have trouble running most demos on your platform of choice, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Annikras">Annikras spent a lot of time capturing demos into high quality videos and uploading them to his youtube channel</a>, which might be useful, although demos are always best experienced running live on their target platform.</p>
<p>There is this great documentary about the demoscene called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRkZcTg1JWU">Moleman 2</a> and if you&rsquo;re a scholar you can find a list of scene related scientific writings <a href="http://www.kameli.net/demoresearch2/">at Demoscene Research site</a>.</p>

<p>Other than your nickname, you don&rsquo;t have to give anyone any information to join the scene or release a production.  However, sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to be able to talk to folks who have been doing this for a while :) .  The easiest way is to register for an account (a &ldquo;SceneID&rdquo;) at <a href="https://id.scene.org/register/">scene.org</a>.  That will give you access to a number of scene websites, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pouet.net">PouÃ«t.net</a>: The largest site for scene-wide discussion of demos and other topics.  The &ldquo;BBS&rdquo; is the discussion forum.  A good idea is to lurk for a while and learn the etiquette before you post!</li>
<li><a href="https://demozoo.org">Demozoo</a>: An archive of information about scene demos, graphics, and music.</li>
<li><a href="http://wanted.scene.org">Wanted!</a>: A site for asking for people to work with you on your releases &mdash; and for offering to work with others on theirs!</li>
</ul>
<p>These sites have a big &ldquo;SceneID&rdquo; button &mdash; click that to login.  It usually looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://howto.planet-d.net/misc/sceneid-login-button.png" alt="SceneID login button image"></p>
<p>Bear in mind that not all demoscene content is necessarily safe for work or suitable for kids.  That said, there is a tremendous amount of information in these sites, and a lot of very experienced people hang out in the forums.</p>
