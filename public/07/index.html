  <h2 id="day-7---experiment">Day 7 - Experiment</h2>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a musician, graphician or coder there is one golden rule in the demoscene: Don&rsquo;t be afraid to experiment. I promise you on first hand experience that as long as you keep experimenting with things you will eventually release something you are truly proud of. So don&rsquo;t be afraid to experiment!</p>
<p>Experiment with tools, experiment with ideas.</p>
<p>Repurpose, remix, discuss things with others.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to fail, it&rsquo;s normal to fail, that&rsquo;s how you find interesting things, that&rsquo;s how you learn. So go forth and fail, fail hard, fail misserably, fail often, eventually you will succeed!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect your first track to be great. Don&rsquo;t expect your first pixel graphics to look good. Don&rsquo;t expect your first demo to be any good. The first demos from 90% of sceners are a total load of crap!</p>
<p>You should also be aware that it&rsquo;s quite common to get creative blocks or lose your motivation to do &ldquo;demoscene things&rdquo; from time to time. Just remember that demoscene is a hobby, you&rsquo;re free to do whatever you want at whatever pace you please. Some sceners take decades to release something, working on their masterpieces on and off!</p>
<p>At the end of day 7 you should now have a good grasp on the importance of experimenting with things.</p>
