  <h2 id="day-14---pouet--scene--scene--pouet">Day 14 - Pouet != Scene &amp;&amp; Scene != Pouet</h2>
<p>After the demoparty comes the official release of your entry.</p>
<p>Most entries nowadays are automatically released by the party voting system. This means they will be uploaded to the internet, where dozens of people will be able to download, watch, listen and inevitably leave their public comments on your entry.</p>
<p>You should be aware by now that most people say things online they would never say in person. Keep in mind you cannot see them, you often don&rsquo;t even know them, it&rsquo;s quite hard to understand what they mean exactly, and quite easy to take negative feedback the wrong way. Don&rsquo;t fall for that trap.</p>
<p>Pouet.net is a website where most demoscene entries are listed and commented on by the international demoscene community. Like any online forum it&rsquo;s quite easy to get misunderstood and start a flamewar over the silliest of things. So this is the most important thing you should know about pouet: Pouet is not the demoscene. And also, the demoscene is not pouet.</p>
<p>Pouet is a place to write your opinions on each others entries, it can also be a great source of community feedback. Pouet is unexplained memes, pigs, buckets, pictures of ponies and trumpets. Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of reading the comments on pouet and taking them too seriously.</p>
<p>Demoscene on the other hand is what you can make of it, it&rsquo;s a supportive community, a culture, some people even call it a family or a way of life.</p>
<p>By the end of the 14th day you should know all about the demoscene, how to make your first entry, the importance of attending demoparties, getting releases finished in time and getting to know the community.</p>
<p>Above all the demoscene is about having fun doing digital art. So make some demos and have fun!</p>
