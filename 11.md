## Day 11 - Get Help

You can do great demos alone. Lots of demosceners make demos alone. That doesn't mean you have to.

Most demosceners prefer to work in groups. There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. Which one you follow entirely depends on your workflow and your ability to find people who share your vision.

Regardless if you work alone or in a demogroup, you may sometimes find yourself in a bit of a pickle halfway through your demo making adventure. If you ever do, you should be aware that you're not alone and that other demosceners tend to be helpful in all sorts of ways:

1. They can lend you their insight into your problem.

2. You can randomly ask them if they are interested in contributing assets to your demo.

3. They tend to share how they have their workflow set up.

4. You can send them previews of your work-in-progress and ask for feedback on how to improve it.

5. They can lend you computers to finish or submit your entry at the partyplace.

6. They can bring you food, beer or coffee while you're busy working on an entry.

7. They might even teach you how to use tools and tricks that make your life easier.

My point is, there are plenty of others that know what you're trying to do and will gladly help you where they can. Most of them have already tackled that specific problem you're trying to solve. So why not ask them for some insight? It might save you many frustrating hours.

If you're shy to approach people, there are also recorded conference talks of demosceners covering different topics of interest to the demoscene which you can find on the internet and learn from.

By the end of the 11th day you should know the importance of getting help when you are in dire need and that demosceners are typically easy to approach on such topics.
