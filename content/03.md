## Day 3 - Basics of Graphics

The role of doing graphics for a demo is typically supported by a so called graphician. To be a successful graphician in the demoscene you should hopefully enjoy drawing and being randomly creative. There are many tools you can use to draw graphics on the computer.

Pixel art graphics typically focus on a limited palette of colors and image size. The restrictions come from the oldschool machines that had such limitations on hardware. Small images are typically called sprites. 2D animations are created by cycling between the different frames of a sprite animation. This is the basis of 2d animation. You can [google for pixel art graphics tools](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=pixel+art+graphics+tools) and find a whole bunch of modern editors for pixel art. Real sceners will tell you about [Grafx2](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=51865) or the more recent [Multipaint](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=66976).

If pixeling makes your stomach all queasy, don't worry, that doesn't mean your career as a graphician will be over before it even started. You can still take the role of 3D modeler (using 3DS Max, Maya, Lightwave, ZBrush, Blender, etc) and 3D animator.

The graphician is often also responsible for the overall design of the demo. Including concept, scene composition, transitions, etc.

Most graphicians are proficient with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, or their (possibly free) alternatives.

By the end of day 3 you should know what tools to use if you want to do graphics for a demo or for a graphics compo entry. So just try a few of them out, check some tutorials, learn the application shortcuts and try to master the most interesting tool you could find.
