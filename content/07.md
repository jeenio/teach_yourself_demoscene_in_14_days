## Day 7 - Experiment

Whether you're a musician, graphician or coder there is one golden rule in the demoscene: Don't be afraid to experiment. I promise you on first hand experience that as long as you keep experimenting with things you will eventually release something you are truly proud of. So don't be afraid to experiment!

Experiment with tools, experiment with ideas.

Repurpose, remix, discuss things with others.

Don't be afraid to fail, it's normal to fail, that's how you find interesting things, that's how you learn. So go forth and fail, fail hard, fail misserably, fail often, eventually you will succeed!

Don't expect your first track to be great. Don't expect your first pixel graphics to look good. Don't expect your first demo to be any good. The first demos from 90% of sceners are a total load of crap!

You should also be aware that it's quite common to get creative blocks or lose your motivation to do "demoscene things" from time to time. Just remember that demoscene is a hobby, you're free to do whatever you want at whatever pace you please. Some sceners take decades to release something, working on their masterpieces on and off!

At the end of day 7 you should now have a good grasp on the importance of experimenting with things.
